Power BI dashboard for Data Science 2023

INTRODUCTION
I have considered the Data Science Salaries 2023 dataset for this dashboard. This dataset covers major roles in DSML, salary in USD, employment type, experience level, company size and location, and employees' location from 2020 to 2023. Nine measurements were created.
OBSERVATIONS
While this data can be used to understand the trend in the sector, we cannot rely on the specific figures due to this data's lack of comprehension.
Every year there has been significant increase in job roles and avg salary in the DSML sector.
Remote roles were above 50%, however, in 2023 this figure went down to 33%.
In 2020 and 2021, most roles were performed by mid-level candidates. However in 2022 and 2023, most of the roles are being performed by senior-level candidates.
 Medium-size companies claim about 84% of hiring in DSML sector.
